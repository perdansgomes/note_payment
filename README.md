# note_payment

I've created a small service for generating notification codes. This very simple code is more to introduce you to my page and not leave it completely empty, along with the HelloWorld repository.

I used Python (version 3.11.4), HTML5, CSS, the Flask framework (2.3.2), the random package and Flask's own functions, such as render_template.

To run the project on your localhost, open the app.py file and have flask, the random package and python installed.
